## THIS SHOULD BE A LITTE INTRODUCTION TO SOME TOOLS I NEED FOR DEVELOPING THE GAME. THE SCRIPTS ARE SELF EXPLANATORY AS I THINK AND VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND. DUH

ALL OF THESE SCRIPTS ARE LINUX-ONLY

---
## install_mgcb.sh

installs mgcb tool

## build_vars.sh

builds all needed variables for all paths needed. This script should ONLY RUN FROM INSIDE THIS FOLDER

## rebuild_content_new.sh

rebuilds content for the desktop client and 
copies all built content files to the Debug content folder. This is hard coded and only for me
